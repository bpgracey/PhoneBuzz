PhoneBuzz
=========

Another employer code test. This time with Twilio.

Phase 1...

Code builds to a self-contained executable jar file. Placed on server & executed, and with a Twilio account set to direct voice calls to port 8080, path /phonebuzz/call, the app will use Twilio to ask a caller to enter a number, and then read back the FizzBuzz list of numbers from 1 to the entered number. A configuration file defines the maximum acceptable number (and there's no way to enter negative numbers!)

Phase 2...

Addition of a web form that takes a number to dial out, starting the same process!
